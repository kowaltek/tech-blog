### Hi there!

My name is Mateusz.
I'm a former vet, who finally found his real passion in computer science.
It really fascinates me that the modern computer works the way it does.
I started like the most of people jumping careers to programming, with python and JS.
But I really love diving in those rabbit holes.
You think C is low level? Wait until you find out about pipelining, branch prediction, etc.
There's always something deeper there.
I'm currently focusing on Go, as it strikes a good balance of productivity and performance for me, plus gives great stability - no new framework every other day or '5 ways to do something'.

Hope you find something helpful here. Enjoy!
